**Main Class:** Demonstrates the operations on the pharmacy by:
- Adding a new medication
- Finding a medication by its name
- Deleting a medication
- Displaying all medications and their details

## Key Concepts:
- Java Map: A HashMap is used to store medications with names as keys.
- CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on medication records.

## Files:
- **Main.java:** Executes and demonstrates the functionality of the Pharmacy class.
- **Medication.java:** Defines the structure of a medication.
- **Pharmacy.java:** Manages the inventory using a HashMap.
